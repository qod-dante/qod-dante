# My Projects on Frontend Mentor

## 1. [News Homepage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/news-homepage-SVTW3-9ZPd)

I gotta admit, I had never used CSS grid before I started this project, but it definitely made for good practicing material, and I absolutely loved it! 😁 (So much so that I mostly forgot how to use Flexbox. Sheesh. 😅)

## 2. [Notifications Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-notifications-page-using-plain-html5css3js-otyuqNQfF4)

- I'm approaching this one with CSS grid too. Wonder how it will turn out... 🤔
- Jan 24, 2023 6:28 PM: I've been struggling with properly learning JavaScript for quite some time now... 🤦‍♂️ it's definetely not easy to learn when you're using a 'learn-in-the-project' approach 😞
- Feb 02, 2023 11:23 PM: FINALLY! Finished the project. Anti-climatically. ✔️

## 3. [Interactive Card Details Form (ON HIATUS)](https://qod-dante.github.io/Interactive-CDF/)

- Feb 14, 2023 3:52 PM: Valentines ❤️ Day! Yep! Still studying even on this day! That was a little tougher than I thought 🥵! This would be the first time I've used CSS positions this extensively. I managed to position the cards as best as I could for the mobile version (600-px). I consider that a milestone. Next up is the form, which I'm sure will be a cinch 😼.
- Feb 15, 2023 3:48 PM: I knew the forms will be a cinch 😁! With the mobile version for small devices out of the way, next up is for bigger devices (Tablets, iPads, etc.).
- Mar 23, 2023 5:29 PM: I'm putting this project on hold for now. Until I'm able to figure out how to automatically add spaces after every 4 digits for the credit card number.

## 4. [Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page](https://qod-dante.github.io/Fylo-Dark-Theme-Landing-Page/)

- Apr 18, 2023 1:20 PM: Been busy with life's challenges. Anyway,  the design notes say the smallest screen size for the design should be 375px. But when I saw the mobile design image, it was 750px, which creates a problem for the `nav` in the `header` section. Unless I decrease the `font-size` or dimensions for the `nav` links, I don't see a way to properly fit the `nav` links, except for one way, and that is to make a collapsible side menu (as is standard for small mobile devices).
