# My Projects on Frontend Mentor

## 1. [News Homepage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/news-homepage-SVTW3-9ZPd)

I gotta admit, I had never used CSS grid before I started this project, but it definitely made for good practicing material, and I absolutely loved it! 😁 (So much so that I mostly forgot how to use Flexbox. Sheesh. 😅)

## 2. [Notifications Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-notifications-page-using-plain-html5css3js-otyuqNQfF4)

- I'm approaching this one with CSS grid too. Wonder how it will turn out... 🤔
- 2023/01/24: I've been struggling with properly learning JavaScript for quite some time now... 🤦‍♂️ it's definetely not easy to learn when you're using a 'learn-in-the-project' approach 😞
- 2023/02/02 11:23 PM: FINALLY! Finished the project. Anti-climatically. ✔️

## 3. [Interactive Card Details Form (In Progress)](https://qod-dante.github.io/Interactive-CDF/)
