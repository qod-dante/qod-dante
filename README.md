# My Projects on Frontend Mentor

## 1. [News Homepage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/news-homepage-SVTW3-9ZPd)

I gotta admit, I had never used CSS grid before I started this project, but it definitely made for good practicing material, and I absolutely loved it! 😁 (So much so that I mostly forgot how to use Flexbox. Sheesh. 😅)

## 2. [Notifications Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-notifications-page-using-plain-html5css3js-otyuqNQfF4)

- I'm approaching this one with CSS grid too. Wonder how it will turn out... 🤔
- Jan 24, 2023 6:28 PM: I've been struggling with properly learning JavaScript for quite some time now... 🤦‍♂️ it's definetely not easy to learn when you're using a 'learn-in-the-project' approach 😞
- Feb 02, 2023 11:23 PM: FINALLY! Finished the project. Anti-climatically. ✔️

## 3. [Interactive Card Details Form (In Progress)](https://qod-dante.github.io/Interactive-CDF/)

- Feb 14, 2023 3:52 PM: Valentines ❤️ Day! Yep! Still studying on this day! That was a little tougher than I thought 🥵! This would be the first time I've used CSS positions this extensively. I managed to position the cards as best as I could for the mobile version (600-px). I consider that a milestone. Next up is the form, which I'm sure will be a cinch 😼.
